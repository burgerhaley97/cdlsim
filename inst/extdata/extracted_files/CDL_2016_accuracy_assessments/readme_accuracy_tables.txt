The strength and emphasis of the CDL is crop-specific land cover categories. The accuracy of the CDL non-agricultural land cover classes is entirely dependent upon the USGS, National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Thus, the USDA, NASS recommends that users consider the NLCD for studies involving non-agricultural land cover.

NOTE ABOUT THE UNBUFFERED VALIDATION ACCURACY TABLES:  The training and validation data used to create and accuracy assess the CDL has traditionally been based on ground truth data that is buffered inward 30 meters. This was done 1) because satellite imagery (as well as the polygon reference data) in the past was not georeferenced to the same precision as now (i.e. everything "stacked" less perfectly), 2) to eliminate from training spectrally-mixed pixels at land cover boundaries, and 3) to be spatially conservative during the era when coarser 56 meter AWiFS satellite imagery was incorporated. Ultimately, all of these scenarios created "blurry" edge pixels through the seasonal time series which it was found if ignored from training in the classification helped improve the quality of CDL. However, the accuracy assessment portion of the analysis also used buffered data meaning those same edge pixels were not assessed fully with the rest of the classification. This would be inconsequential if those edge pixels were similar in nature to the rest of the scene but they are not- they tend to be more difficult to classify correctly. Thus, the accuracy assessments as have been presented are inflated somewhat. Beginning with the 2016 CDL season we are creating CDL accuracy assessments using unbuffered validation data. These "unbuffered" accuracy metrics will now reflect the accuracy of field edges which have not been represented previously. We will continue to publish the traditional "buffered" accuracy metrics within the official metadata files and offer the full "buffered" error matrices for download on the FAQs webpage. Both metadata and FAQs are accessible at <https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/SARS1a.php>. We will now also offer the full "unbuffered" error matrices for download on the FAQs webpage. The 2016 CDL is the first year these "unbuffered" accuracy assessments will be made available and we plan to continue producing these unbuffered accuracy assessments for future CDLs. However, there are no plans to create these unbuffered accuracy assessments for past years. It should be noted that accuracy assessment is challenging and the CDL group has always strived to provide robust metrics of usability to the land cover community. This admission of modestly inflated accuracy measures does not render past assessments useless. They were all done consistently so comparison across years and/or states is still valid. Yet, by now providing both scenarios for 2016, and then into the future, gives guidance on the bias.

NOTE ABOUT OLDER ACCURACY TABLES:  The 1997-2013 CDLs were recoded and re-released in January 2014 to better represent pasture and grass-related categories and to better align the historical CDLs with the current product. Most of these category changes were in the non-agriculture domain. Some of these recodes may alter the validity of older accuracy tables. For a detailed list of the category name and code changes, please visit the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's) section at <http://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/SARS1a.php>.

DEFINITONS OF ACCURACY ASSESSMENT METRICS:  These definitions of accuracy statistics were derived from the following book: Congalton, Russell G. and Kass Green. Assessing the Accuracy of Remotely Sensed Data: Principles and Practices. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press, Inc. 1999. The 'Producer's Accuracy' is calculated for each cover type in the ground truth and indicates the probability that a ground truth pixel will be correctly mapped (across all cover types) and measures 'errors of omission'. An 'Omission Error' occurs when a pixel is excluded from the category to which it belongs in the validation dataset. The 'User's Accuracy' indicates the probability that a pixel from the CDL classification actually matches the ground truth data and measures 'errors of commission'. The 'Commission Error' represent when a pixel is included in an incorrect category according to the validation data. It is important to take into consideration errors of omission and commission. For example, if you classify every pixel in a scene to 'wheat', then you have 100% Producer's Accuracy for the wheat category and 0% Omission Error. However, you would also have a very high error of commission as all other crop types would be included in the incorrect category. The 'Kappa' is a measure of agreement based on the difference between the actual agreement in the error matrix (i.e., the agreement between the remotely sensed classification and the reference data as indicated by the major diagonal) and the chance agreement which is indicated by the row and column totals. The 'Conditional Kappa Coefficient' is the agreement for an individual category within the entire error matrix.
